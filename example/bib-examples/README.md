Stripped down LaTeX file for showing bibliographies, produced different ways.

Note: the files `ACM-Reference-Format.bst` and `sample-bibliography.bib` have been copied straight from https://github.com/borisveytsman/acmart

The pdf files are produced from `natbibdoc.tex` using different bibliography style files (.bst files).
