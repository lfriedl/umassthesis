Stripped down LaTeX file for showing bibliographies, produced different ways.

The documents `natbibdoc-*.pdf` are produced from `natbibdoc.tex` using different bibliography style files (.bst files).
The documents `biblatexdoc-*.pdf` are produced from `biblatexdoc.tex` using different biblatex styles (optional customization using `biblatex-myheaders.tex`). 

Note: the files `ACM-Reference-Format.bst` and `sample-bibliography.bib` were copied straight from https://github.com/borisveytsman/acmart. A few additional entries were then added to `sample-bibliography.bib`.
